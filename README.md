## ðŸ“š Usage

To use this component in your project, import it and add it to your component tree.

**Basic Example**

```tsx
import EmailComponentExample from "./example/EmailComponentExample";
import "./styles/App.scss";

export type EmailObject = {
	id: number;
	email: string;
};

export default function App() {
	return (
		<div className="flex h-screen w-full justify-between relative flex-col">
			<div className="flex flex-col px-4 py-6 items-center w-full">
				<header className="flex flex-col items-center gap-9">
					<h1 className="leading text-2xl font-bold text-blue-800">
						Email Input Example
					</h1>
				</header>
				<EmailComponentExample />
			</div>
		</div>
	);
}
```

## ðŸ“œ Props, Design and structure

- `EmailObject`: An object holding a unique id and an email address. In this example that isn't neccesarily needed, we could just use the email string, but if it was used in a larger app having an id to point to email address can be cleaner.

For styling I used a combination of Tailwind.css and SCSS. Most of the app uses Tailwind for layout, but I added a few custom classes for components requiring a bit more complex or detailed styling, for maintainability. If I were to expand this app I would make these components more reusable, and give each one it's own stylesheet in an individual component folder.

\*\*\*\*For example

```
src
  -components
    --Button
      ---Button.tsx
      ---Button.scss
    --EmailInput
      ---EmailInput.tsx
      ---EmailInput.scss
```

For the SCSS I used variables and mixins, which is best for a single source of truth in a bigger app.
